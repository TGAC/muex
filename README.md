# `muex`

This is the repository containing the Snakemake implementation of Muex, a method to identify novel microexons from long-read RNA sequence data.

## DISCLAIMER: Not yet ready for public use

This implementation of Muex is still a work-in-progress. Bookmark/star/watch this space for a completed pipeline, installation instructions and user documentation, and hopefully one day a preprint.
